# GeneraScript-AI
This project combines Mistral and CodeLlama models for seamless generative automation, producing dynamic scripts and automated test code. Using NLP-driven parsing and embedded vector indexing, it enables multi-model orchestration for end-to-end code synthesis, accelerating development and minimizing manual coding.
